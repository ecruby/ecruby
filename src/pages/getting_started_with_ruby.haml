  %h3 Getting Ruby set up on your machine
  %p 
    Ruby is relatively easy to install on nearly every platform. However, we recommend installing
    %strong
      Ruby 1.9.2
    at the moment.
     
.grid_6

    %h4 Windows
    %p 
      Windows users can grab the 
      =link_to "RubyInstaller For Windows", "http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/"
      which will install Ruby and the Rubygems package manager.
    %p Once installed, open a Command Prompt and type
    %pre
      :preserve
        gem update --system
    %p This updates Rubygems to the latest version if necessary.
    
    %p 
      Next, follow 
      = link_to "these instructions", "http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/"
      to install additional components for Ruby libraries that need to be compiled.
      
    %h2 Need a Ruby editor?
    %p 
      We recommend 
      =link_to "RedCar", "http://redcareditor.com/"
      which you can install as a RubyGem.
    %pre
      :preserve
        gem install redcar
        redcar install

    %h4 Mac OS X
    %p
      Both Leopard and Snow Leopard come with Ruby already installed,
      You'll be happier if you use RVM, the Ruby Version Manager.
      To do this, you'll need the GCC compilers. Install XCode from your
      OSX DVD, or grab prebuilt compilers from
      =link_to "here", "https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads"
    %p
      Next, install Git using the
      = link_to "Git OSX Installer", "http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3"
    %p
      Finally, open a Terminal and type these commands:
    %pre
      :preserve
        bash < <( curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm )
        echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ' >> ~/.bash_profile
    
    %p Now close and restart Terminal. Then type
    %pre
      :preserve
        rvm install 1.9.2
        rvm --default 1.9.2
              
    %h2 Need a Ruby editor?
    %p 
      We recommend 
      =link_to "Textmate", "http://download-b.macromates.com/TextMate_1.5.9.dmg"
      (30 day trial, OS X DMG)

    %h4 Linux (Ubuntu)
    %p 
      Use
      %strong
        rvm
      the Ruby Version Manager, to get everything running. Type these commands from a new Terminal:
    %pre
      :preserve
        sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core curl
        
        bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
        
        echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"' >> ~/.bashrc 
        
        sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 \
        libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev \
        libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev \
        libxslt-dev autoconf
    
    %p Now close and restart your Terminal, and type:
    %pre
      :preserve
        rvm install 1.9.2
        
        rvm --default use 1.9.2
        

    %p Next, install RubyGems to manage packages
    %pre
      :preserve
        mkdir src
        cd src
        wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60718/rubygems-1.3.5.tgz
        tar xzvf rubygems-1.3.5.tgz
        cd rubygems-1.3.5
        sudo ruby setup.rb
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/bin/gem
        sudo gem update --system
   
    %h2 Need a Ruby editor?
    %p 
      We recommend Vim. A 
      =link_to "Rails plugin", "http://rails.vim.tpope.net/"
      is available.
  .box
    %h2 Rails
    %p 
      To install Rails on Windows, simply download the
      =link_to "RailsInstaller for Windows", "http://railsinstaller.com"
      to get Ruby, Rails, and everything else installed.
        
    %p To install on Linux or Mac OSX, open a terminal and type:
    %pre
      :preserve
        gem install rails
